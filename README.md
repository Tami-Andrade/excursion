# Excursion

A simple project to practice Git and GitHub commands such as creating a repository, adding files, and committing changes. And finally, to verify the final results: GitHub Pages.

## Description

The project was developed as a task of the [CodeAcademy Git & GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-git) course with the materials and directions provided.

As the repo is public and GitHub Pages is configured, feel free to navigate to the sample website used to learn: [http://tami-andrade.github.io/excursion](http://tami-andrade.github.io/excursion).
